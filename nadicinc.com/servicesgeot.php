                            <p>At the outset of most civil engineering projects, the owner and the designer need an accurate idea of the subsurface conditions at the site and how they can impact the design, constructability and performance of the structure. </p> 
                            <p><strong>Nadic specializes in this kind of work. Our engineers coordinate field work and design interpretation, and have the flexibility to change procedures as new information and condition warrant.</strong> Whether we are investigating subsurface conditions or designing slope stabilization systems, we strive to bring innovative and cost-saving solutions to the project. </p>
