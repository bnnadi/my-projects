						  <p><strong>Maintaining high standards through excellence in construction materials testing and inspections</strong></p>


<p>Nadic's construction materials testing and inspection services use AASHTO accredited laboratories and field testing performed by certified technicians. These services include verification of material standards and quality, and construction quality control (CQC) and construction quality assurance (CQA). Nadic stresses that construction quality control is not simply performing field and laboratory tests during construction, but a method of providing the owner, designer and contractor with valuable information and test results throughout a project's progress.
