					<p>   My name is Ty, and I like to make <strong>"mistakes”</strong>. After being on this planet for 26 years I have learned that there are 2 very different sides to me. On one hand there is “sober Ty” which is a responsible, caring, somewhat shy, nice guy who helps his friends and family with no hesitation. On the other hand you have “drunk Ty” which is an irresponsible, alcoholic, careless, jerk who only cares about himself when and where he is getting his next drink, and how he is going to use a helpless unsuspecting girl to fulfill his sexual needs. “Drunk Ty” also somehow manages to become very influential to where I can talk people into doing things they normally wouldn’t. I definitely do not consider myself an alcoholic, however, once I catch a buzz there is no stopping the drunk train until there is some sort of dramatic event to where I have no choice but to stop drinking or I pass out. Even though I have all of these different sides to me I think there is one word that can completely describe me… shameless. I like to joke that I make mistakes all the time, but there is nothing that I have done or experienced in my life that I feel any shame for… I am “shameless Ty”. Over the years I have had many experiences with alcohol and all its wonderment and have decided that some of my stories are just too good to keep to myself. I hope you enjoy reading these as much as I did living them…who knows maybe one day you will be a part of one. </p>
