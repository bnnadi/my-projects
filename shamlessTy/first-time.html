				<h2>My First Time</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						This is not the first time I got laid! That would be the shortest story ever.... “and then he came-the end”. The first time I had sex was maybe 35 seconds, which I was pretty upset about since I started masterbating at the ripe age of 12 years old. Basically the moment I discovered the fact that I had a penis, and that jerking on it felt great. Due to that fact I thought I had so much more control over my cock. So no this is not the story of the first time I had sex...this would be the story of the first time I ever got drunk.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Throughout my childhood I had tried different types of beers a few times by just having sips of my father’s and I never liked any of it. To me beer was very bitter and gross...Then the ending result from all this drinking was that no one could wake up to make me breakfast in the morning. Why does everyone like to drink alcohol? When I was 17, a senior in high school, there was a girl I liked “Jessica”. This girl seemed great! She was about 5’1” with silky, dark brown hair that seemed to flow off her head down to just above her tits. She had a pretty face, and a very nice figure of about 100 pounds. This girl was skinny but still had great tits and I needed to see them! I only liked Jessica because of the way she looked...I mean let’s face it, is there any other reason to be interested in a female? I had never spent enough time around her to know what she was really like outside of school, and boy was I in for a surprise. Being so young I did not know much of anything about girls other than the fact that I just want to sleep with all of them. By now I had had sex a few times, but I was very shy and pretty much sweet and innocent at this point in my life. I was still  just a nice guy...the angel of alcohol had not had the opportunity to grace my life yet to turn me into the selfish raging ass whole that I am today. Valentines Day was coming up soon. I build up all my pussy courage to ask Jessica to hang out with me.

						Ty- “Hey Jessica, do you have any plans for valentines day?

					</p>
					<p>
						Jessica- “no not yet, what are you doing?”
					</p>
					<p>
						Ty- “well my buddy’s parents are going to be out of town for the weekend so we were thinking of having a little get together over there. He has a girl that will be coming over also”
					</p>
					<p>
						Jessica- “that sounds great I would love to go”
					</p>
					<p>
						I don't know why I'm such a pussy when I'm sober. I rarely talk to girls that I do not know well or ask them to go out with me, but when I do the results are normally pretty good.
					</p>

						I have known Mr. Right for several years. We met around 7th grade at a skating rink where we both played hockey. Both of us being very competitive we played hard against each other, and soon became team  mates to dominate and try to beat everyone else! I have given him the name Mr. Right because he is amazing with first impressions! There is no shyness there for him. He can pretty much convince a girl that he is “THE ONE” and they will leave the man they are with, quit school, quit their job, and move away with him. He even pulls this off with females parents! Which I do not understand because I don’t think I have ever had anyones parents like me. Definitely not a girl I have been pursuing.  I never knew how he always pulled this shit off, but it didn’t really matter. He has always been great about keeping me in mind when talking to a group of girls. Whenever Mr. Right is around the pussy is not far behind.
